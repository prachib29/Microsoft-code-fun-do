# Microsoft-code-fun-do

My idea is to update the phone number of each and every voter with the election commision. If someone casts his/her vote a messege/SMS will be sent to the phone number of the voter. This will help voters when somone else has casted their vote. They will be notified via the SMS and they will be able to take action against it by notifying to the election commision.

# Safety Features
1. Such methods may be vulnurable to Malware ,Dos attacks. But using specified netwoks(eg. the networks used in banks), tjis process can be improved.
2. The phone number linked to the aadhar no. of the person will only be used so as to reduce forgeries.
3. To ensure fair voting use of biometrics can be done.
